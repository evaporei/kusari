# docs

There's a rough design image in this directory that I'll probably follow, for now that's basically not readable for any person other than me.

These are the components that I intend on creating:

- [x] Make draft design
- [ ] HTTP Server
- [ ] Transaction Receiver/Emitter
- [ ] Transaction Pool
- [ ] Executor
- [ ] Valid Transactions List
- [ ] Miner
- [ ] Block Emitter
- [ ] World State
- [ ] Validator/Block PoW Receiver
- [ ] Forker
